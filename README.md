# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
## 100-days-of-code - [Imdone](https://imdone.io) template
This board is configured to write all cards created in [imdone](https://imdone.io) to [log.md](log.md).  You can easily create log entries as cards on your board.  Each card will be pre-populated with the template defined in log.md front-matter.

Read the comments in [log.md](log.md) to learn how the template works.

The cards in the next section will walk you through how to use this board.

## Imdone cards
### [:100: Days of code with imdone!](#TODO:0)
<!-- Due in 10 minutes. -->
- [ ] Drag this card to **DOING**
- [ ] Set your `startDate` in [log.md on line 5](/log.md:5) (It's just [yaml](https://yaml.org))
  - Click the "**log.md on line 5**" link above to open your log.md at line 5.
  - Replace the date with your start date
<!-- -->
If the top card in the **NOTE** list now reads "**...Day 1...**", drag this card to **DONE**.

### [Create a log entry card](#TODO:10)
<!-- Due in 20 minutes. -->
- Click the "Add a card" button at the bottom of this list
- Fill it out with brief progress, thoughts and links.

### [Tweet your progress](#TODO:20)
<!-- Due in 20 minutes. -->
- Click the tweet link that appears in your new card as you hover over it

### [Customize your imdone template](#TODO:30)
- [ ] Read the [README.md](README.md) file.
- [ ] Read the front-matter comments in [log.md](log.md)
- [ ] Examine the [.imdone/config.yml](.imdone/config.yml) file.
  - This is where your board settings are saved.

## If you've decided to join:

0.  Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect
    Also, [here](https://join.slack.com/t/100xcode/shared_invite/enQtNzQwMzIwMzQxODc5LWQwMjU5Mjg0N2ZiMzIzYzJiZmE0YjNiYTBiZDBjNjlkNjBmMTYxNDBmNmE2YmE2YzY4NTgzY2Y5NDQxNWY5ZDM) is a invite link to the 100DaysOfCode Slack channel
1.  Read [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
2.  Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) or to the Alternative, rapid [R1 Log](r1-log.md) (R1 stands for Round 1) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
6.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
7.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
8.  Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
9.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
10.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)

## Want to change other habits?

Check out [the #100DaysOfX Challenges Project](http://100daysofx.com/). Changing your habits you are changing your life. Remember that the best time to start is always NOW.

I recommend that you commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2. If you are doing the #100DaysOfCode which involves a lot of mental activity, try the [#100DaysOfHealth](http://100daysofx.com/where-x-is/health/), or [#100DaysOfFitness](http://100daysofx.com/challenges/) challenges. There is so much more on the site, check all of them out and choose the ones you want to acquire! Languages, writing, meditation, journaling, cooking, and more!
